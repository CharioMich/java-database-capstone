# Smart Clinic Management System Full-Stack App

This is the main project from [Java Development Capstone Project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-development-capstone-project) course
and was created using [okssu-java-database-capstone-template](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/okssu-java-database-capstone-template) template.



This is a Spring Boot full-stack application following the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architectural pattern.  
It represents a Clinic Management System (CMS) providing both Thymeleaf templates and REST APIs.
The application interacts with two databases—MySQL (for patient, doctor, appointment, and admin data) and MongoDB (for prescriptions).

Since Spring MVC is used for this project, code is organized into three layers:

- Model: Data and business logic  
- View: UI or presentation layer  
- Controller: Handles input and orchestrates between Model and View

Info: Big enumerated comment blocks in some project files are the initial code development instructions provided by the course.
